# Ni18n

Is an easy to use integration for [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) to enable [i18next](https://www.i18next.com/) translations on your application with support for SSR and SSG.

It gives you freedom to use `i18next` with a lot of different customizations, while still being compatible with `next.js`.

`Ni18n` also does not directly depend on `i18next` nor `react-i18next`, allowing you to update these dependencies without having to wait for any action on our part.

## Installing

```shell
yarn add i18next react-i18next ni18n
```

```shell
npm install i18next react-i18next ni18n
```
